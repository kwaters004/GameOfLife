Game of life updates to make:

Double check the "Alive" indicator. It had a bug earlier that made it display 2 when nothing was selected.

Add in 3 speed options. Probably going to create another grid to house them.
Add a clear button to clear the board.



Question, do i want to keep the same Dictionary the whole time and just have it be built out for
	the maximum possible number? Might need to see what is driving the loops. Would need it to be buttons.



Add functionality in to draw larger areas
Also, should look into whether or not i can drap and drop or something.
